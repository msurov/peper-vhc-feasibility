	The abstract does not mention the scope of the results or any
methodology to address or remove the identified deficiency.


Therefore, it is primarily descriptive and lacks any indication of novelty or a proposed solution.
It highlights the existence of certain stabilizable trajectories that do not fit within the conventional VHC framework,
but does not articulate a new method, theoretical extension, or design innovation to address this issue.
- Это ошибочное утверждение. Новый метод представлен.

The sentence stating that “a typical criterion is the existence of stabilizing feedback which ensures that the planned motion can be executed on a physical system” appears to be incomplete in the context of underactuated mechanical systems. While such a criterion is indeed relevant, it is important to emphasize that, in underactuated systems, the mere existence of a stabilizing feedback law is not sufficient. For a motion plan to be truly feasible, the associated zero dynamics must also be stable.
- Откуда ты эту глупость взял? Подобные утверждения стоит подкреплять ссылками на публикации.

 It is therefore recommended that the authors clarify this important aspect, particularly given the focus of the paper on systems with a single degree of under actuation.

Please clarify whether the “closed-loop system” mentioned in
Definition 1 specifically refers to system (1).
- я привожу чужое определение, почему я должен пояснять?!

It is recommended to move Figures 1 and 2 after the relevant
discussion in the main text, rather than placing it beforehand. This adjustment would improve the logical flow of presentation and help readers interpret the figure with the necessary context.
- очень серьёзное замечание

In the sentence “According to [8, Chapter 6], the set &#915; is
controlled invariant if and only if, for every …”, the reference to an
entire chapter may be too vague for a claim of this specificity.
Moreover, I was unable to locate a statement in Chapter 6 of [8] that
explicitly supports the equivalence claimed by the authors.
- не дочитал до конца первую страницу главы?

For better clarity and traceability, especially when referring to precise
mathematical conditions such as controlled invariance, it is advisable
to cite a specific theorem or lemma rather than an entire chapter.
This would help readers and reviewers verify the claim more efficiently.
please point me to the exact location (e.g., theorem number or page) in
[8] where your statement—specifically the “if and only if”
characterization of controlled invariance-is formally stated.

In the paragraph following “We define the new coordinates as…”,
the trajectory x^* (&#964;) is referenced without an explicit
definition of its functional form.
For clarity and completeness, it is
important to define it at once after call it-for example, if x^*
(&#964;)=sin&#8289;&#12310;(&#964;)&#12311;, this should be explicitly
stated. 
	In your construction of the transverse coordinates, you define
&#964;:=atan2(x,x &#775;) and claim that the transformation (q,q
&#775;)&#8614;(&#964;,&#961;) is diffeomorphic within a tubular
neighborhood of the orbit. However, since atan2(x,x &#775;) is
undefined when x &#775;=0, it appears that the transformation may
become singular at such continues points. This raises the question:
Could you please clarify how you handle the singularity at x &#775;=0
for arbitrary x, and whether the transformation remains diffeomorphic
in a strict mathematical sense throughout the entire neighborhood?
- там же написано: "within a tubular neighborhood"

Furthermore, considering that the feedback control law (11) is
expressed in terms of &#964;(q,q &#775;), what happens to the control
input u(q,q &#775;) near such continuous singular points?
- Регулятор обеспечивает локальную устойчивость.

In particular, in Section D, you initialize the simulation with x
&#775;=0, which corresponds to a singularity of the transformation.
- I do not initialize x with 0. Where did you get it?

The manuscript predominantly cites works published before 2016.
It would benefit from including more recent literature to better
reflect the current state of research in the field and to contextualize
the contributions with respect to the latest developments
For instance, the paper "Dynamic virtual holonomic constraints for stabilization of closed orbits in underactuated mechanical systems" could provide useful insights and a contemporary perspective closely
related to the topic.
