The paper discusses the existence of virtual holonomic constraints that
do not satisfy the controlled invariance condition of Definition 1.

The topic is interesting  and relevant. Condition 1 considerably
simplifies the discussion of the reduced dynamics, since it avoids
singularities, such as $\alpha(\theta)=0$ in (12). However, it is
certainly true that constraints not satisfying condition 1 can still
be satisfied by some solutions, as shown in the PVTOL example.

In general, the paper’s motivation and the presentation are
clear. I have the following remarks:

- In the PVTOL example, it is assumed that the coupling factor
$\epsilon$ is zero. This is a simplification of the complete model
(equation (6) of reference [12]). Can the example presented in the
paper be extended to the more general setting of $\epsilon \neq 0$?

- The real contribution of the paper under review with respect to
reference [20] is not completely clear. In particular, reference [20]
already presents a virtual constraint for the Furuta pendulum in which
Definition 1 is not satisfied, since $\alpha$ crosses 0. The fact that
$ \alpha$ crosses 0 and that Definition 1 is not satisfied are
equivalent. Also, the method for orbital stabilization presented in the
paper is not new.  The author should state more clearly the new
information presented in the paper with respect to [20].
