Four reviews have been received for this manuscript, where some
significant issues have been raised. After a thorough evaluation of the
paper and the reviewers' comments, I concur with their critical
assessments. While the topic is conceptually relevant, the manuscript
in its current form does not meet the journal’s standards for
scientific rigor or presentation.

The primary concern is the lack of a substantive theoretical
contribution. The paper identifies a limitation in the conventional VHC
framework using a specific case study (the PVTOL system), but it does
not offer a novel analytical result, design method, or extended theory
to address the limitation. In particular, the paper falls short of
proposing a mathematically rigorous and well-posed alternative
definition of VHCs—something that would be essential to justify the
critique of the existing framework. Without this, the manuscript’s
terminology and conclusions
remain ambiguous or even misleading. Developing such a definition is a
complex and nontrivial task that goes well beyond the scope of a
standard revision.

Moreover, the main observation—that certain stabilizable trajectories
may lie outside the constraint manifolds defined by VHCs—is already
recognized in the literature and does not lead to new insights or
tools. The method for orbital stabilization employed in the paper is
also not novel. As a result, the manuscript does not clearly articulate
what distinguishes its contribution from prior work.

The quality of the presentation further limits the paper’s impact. As
noted by multiple reviewers, the manuscript reads more like a technical
report highlighting an observation than a research article offering a
substantial advancement. There are also several technical ambiguities
and gaps in the manuscript.   

The author is encouraged to further develop these ideas into a formal
and well-motivated theoretical framework, which could potentially form
the basis of a new and publishable contribution in the future.
