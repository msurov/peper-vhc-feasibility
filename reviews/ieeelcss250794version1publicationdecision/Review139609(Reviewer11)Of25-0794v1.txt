This work studies the feasibility of virtual holonomic constraints
(VHCs) in motion planning for underactuated mechanical systems. The
main objective is to demonstrate that the conventional definition of
VHCs is restrictive, excluding a broad class of admissible
trajectories. To illustrate this, the paper considers a periodic motion
of the Planar Vertical Take-Off and Landing aircraft and shows that no
VHC satisfying the standard definition can reproduce this motion.

There are several serious concerns regarding this work. 
First, the current manuscript resembles a report more than a scientific paper. 
In particular, the introduction is non-standard: it does not clearly
motivate the problem and instead includes a substantial amount of
mathematics, even including a formal definition within the
introduction.
- What does "standard introduction" mean?

Additionally, many parts of the introduction are highlighted in bold, further reinforcing the report-like appearance.
- I can demonstrate tens of published papers with the same style.

The references are grouped without elaborating on their significance or details, and the notation part is presented using bullet points, which is uncommon and consumes excessive space.
- Is this a "serious concerns"? If usage the "bullet points" is such a "serious concerns" as others, then the paper must has been well-written.

Another serious concern relates to the technical contribution of the
paper. There is no concrete result; the author only demonstrates,
through a specific case study, that no VHC satisfies the conventional
definition.
- Not only. The reviewer didn't read the paper.

However, this observation does not lead to any general insight, and the author does not propose any solution to address this
limitation.
- The solution is presented. The reviewer didn't read the conclusion.

The only formal result is Theorem 2, which shows the existence of a singularity in the reduced model, which is very straightforward.
- "only formal result" the reviewer has found is Theorem 2. If this theorem is straightforward, it does not imply that it is not novel.

In addition to the issues with the introduction, the paper is not well written overall. 
There are some typos throughout the manuscript (for example in Theorem 1).
- If the reviewer found typos, it would make sense to specify them. 

The formal statements throughout the paper have also not been properly motivated.

Given these critical issues, the reviewer believes that the current manuscript is far from meeting the standards of LCSS and does not recommend it for publication.
- Remember, the critical issues are the "non-standard introduction" and "using bullet points".
