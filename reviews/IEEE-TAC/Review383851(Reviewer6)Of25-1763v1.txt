The paper discusses the existence of virtual holonomic constraints that
do not satisfy the controlled invariance condition of Definition 1.

The topic is interesting  and relevant. Condition 1 considerably
simplifies the discussion of the reduced dynamics, since it avoids
singularities, such as $\alpha(\theta)=0$ in (12). However, it is
certainly true that constraints not satisfying condition 1 can still
be satisfied by some solutions, as shown in the PVTOL example.

Anyway, the paper contribution is not clear. In particular, reference
[14]
already presents a virtual constraint for the Furuta pendulum in which
Definition 1 is not satisfied, since $\alpha$ crosses 0. The fact that
$ \alpha$ crosses 0 and that Definition 1 is not satisfied are
equivalent. See also

Also, the method for orbital stabilization presented in the
paper is not new.  In general, in my opinion, the paper lacks a clear
new contribution and the proposed material is not sufficient for
publication.

Moreover, some of the material of this paper has already been published
in:

Surov, M. Singular motion generators in the problem of motion planning
for underactuated mechanical systems. Nonlinear Dyn (2025). 

This paper has not even been cited.
