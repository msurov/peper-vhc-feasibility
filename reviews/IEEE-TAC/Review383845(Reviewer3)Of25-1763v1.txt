This paper shows that the conditions assumed to be necessary for
constructing virtual holonomic constraints (VHC) in many references in
the literature are, in fact, only sufficient and restrictive. While the
paper is (mostly) well-written and mathematically rigorous, more
discussion and context are necessary to understand and evaluate the
relevance of the results, especially what these results mean for motion
planning and path-following. My specific comments, in order of
importance, are as follows:

[C1] It seems clear from the analysis that characterizing (or defining)
VHCs through Definition 1 is restrictive. However, what is unclear to
this reviewer is the implications of this. On the one hand, the author
acknowledges that several references have a more general (and to some
extent appropriate) definition of VHC, implying that not all the
existing literature has adopted an inadequate approach to defining
VHCs. On the other hand, it is unclear how proposing a more general
definition of VHCs "advances" the study of motion planning and
path-following. In other words, the problem highlighted by the author
pertains only to VHCs, but there are other approaches to generate
trajectories or paths. For instance, the one adopted in
constraint-following (servo) control. In this sense, I think it is
essential to discuss how a more general definition of VHCs situates
this approach in the field of motion planning. A possibly good starting
point for this discussion is to compare the general definition of VHCs
with the construction of the constraints proposed in:

Systems" Journal of Vibration and Control
[C2] Assuming that Theorem 1 is relevant, why is there no proof? I
could not find the proof in [14] either.
[C3] The adjoint (in this case, the Lie bracket) ad_{f}g_{i} needs to
be defined in the notation. 
[C4] The equivalent/identical symbol (three horizontal lines) is used
to define expressions in the paper. A symbol that denotes definition
(e.g., ':=' or the equal with a triangle on top) seems more
appropriate. 
[C5] The acronym PVTOL is not used in the abstract and should be
removed. Then, it must be defined in the main text.
[C6] The statements in Theorems 1 and 2 exhibit minor details. In the
former, "Let us consider" can/should be reduced to "Consider."
Similarly, "with the coefficients" --> "with coefficients," "Then, for
any" --> "For any" ("The" is rarely used after a period in a
mathematical statement). In Theorem 2, "trajectory to the system" -->
"trajectory of the system." "Then, for any" --> "For any." 
[C7] The first element of eigvalsW(0,2/pi) reads 744. Is there
something after the period?
