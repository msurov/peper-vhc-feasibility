In this paper, the author examines the existence of virtual holonomic
constraints (VHCs) that do not meet the controlled invariance condition
as outlined in Definition 1. While the topic is intriguing and
relevant, the manuscript reads more like a technical report
demonstrating that the conditions for VHCs are sufficient, rather than
presenting new research advances in the field. The main theoretical
results of the paper are Theorems 1 and 2. It is important to note that
Theorem 1 is sourced from [14], while Theorem 2 is more of a remark
than a formal theorem. This remark highlights that the "regularity"
condition of VHCs limits the class of trajectories that can be
stabilized using the VHC method. This limitation is already well-known
from the work of Shiriaev, published two decades ago.
